# Milestone2
Creation of a BlackJack game in Python for the 2nd Milestone Project in the 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp on Udemy

What do I do next:
    - I want to go through the code and test to make sure the functions are working as intended up to this point
    - Start building out the game logic immediately to make sure that things are working. Currently it's just too abstract.
    - Does a player class need to be defined to provide an attribute that distinguishes between player and dealer?
